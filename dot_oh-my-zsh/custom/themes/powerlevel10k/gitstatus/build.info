# This value gets embedded in gitstatusd at build time. It is

# This value is also read by shell bindings (indirectly, through

# libgit2 is a build time dependency of gitstatusd. The values of
# libgit2_version and libgit2_sha256 are read by ./build.
#
# If ./deps/libgit2-${libgit2_version}.tar.gz doesn't exist, build
# downloads it from the following location:
#
#   https://github.com/romkatv/libgit2/archive/${libgit2_version}.tar.gz
#
# Once downloaded, the tarball is stored at the path indicated
# above so that repeated builds don't consume network bandwidth.
#
# If sha256 of ./deps/libgit2-${libgit2_version}.tar.gz doesn't match,
# build gets aborted.
